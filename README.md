*Chhum: the "chh" is pronounced like the ch in "churn" and "chhum" rhymes with "gum".*

What are your primary goals as a human being?
---

- To create, and learn how to create 🧶
- To celebrate those who bring me joy 🎀
- To leave things a little bit better than the way I found them 🌤

🥲 What do you want us to know about your communication style?
---
- I am a 9 on the Enneagram scale: “The Peacemaker”. I seek to avoid conflict and create resolutions to keep social situations running smoothly.
- I write better than I speak, and process written word better than audio. However, I form better relationships face-to-face (or in Zoom). 

🙃 What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
---
- In a work setting, I am a solid balance of finding the fun in things as well as getting-down-to-business. Sometimes I can get down to business in a meeting too fast if many ideas/tasks/questions are racing in my mind. 
- I come from a teaching background, so I appreciate entering projects and topics with organisation: measurable objectives, clearly-defined task assignments, and deadlines.
- I learn best if I know “why” we use that method first. I often will work backward with my learning. For example, when learning to code, I need to see the end result project first before I can dive into the reference materials of functions and loops.

🌝 How can you best work with me?
---
- My best coworker relationships are with people who can laugh through the tough tasks and find humor in the day.
- I’m always seeking to grow but can be mildly sensitive, so feedback is appreciated if it is delivered from a growth-mindset perspective. I do want to know how I can improve at things.
- I love collaboration. I love to learn from others and teach others what I know. I love to see the unique ways people pursue projects and think.

😠 What are your pet peeves?
---
- When there is no space in the conversation left for others, such as those who are quieter or take longer to process responses.
- Lack of consideration for the community.

😅 What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
---
- I’m practicing being more direct (challenging my inner “peacemaker”).
